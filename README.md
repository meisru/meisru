# About me ðŸŒ¸

I'm a passionate computer science student, currently diving into **front-end web development**, with an aspire to become a full-stack developer. My vision is to create impactful and valuable websites and applications.

I am very enthusiastic about making the technical and visual elements of digital products come to life. I care deeply about user experience, achieving precise design details, and writing clean, efficient code.

I began my journey in 2022, and since then, I've continued to grow, taking on new challenges and learning new things along the way. 

When I'm not on developer mode, you'll find me reading, learning new things, or enjoying some free time ðŸ“š.
